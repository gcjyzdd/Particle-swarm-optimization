# Particle-swarm-optimization

This is the basic PSO algorithm written in Matlab. The code is vectorized and uses parallel computing toolbox optionally. Demos and examples are included.

It is a good example to learn how to implement PSO algorithm and is suitable for global optimization of parameter estimation of large scale nonlinear systems.

Improvements to increase convergence speed wil be made latter.
